# Introduction to TensorFlow — PyData Denver (2018)

This repository contains materials for a hands-on TensorFlow workshop
presented at the PyData Denver meetup in January 2018.

The meetup drew record RSVPs and was moved to a larger space at Galvanize
Platte due to demand.

You can also find the original meetup event details here:
[TensorFlow presentation](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Denver/events/246038964/).

## Audience

The session was aimed at Python practitioners interested in learning how to use
TensorFlow for practical machine learning examples, with attendees encouraged to
follow along live on their laptops.

## Format

The talk began with a brief introduction to TensorFlow and a comparison with
Theano, Keras, and PyTorch, then moved from core concepts into a live demo
building multiple models.

## Pre-work

Attendees were strongly encouraged to bring laptops and complete setup before
the meetup: clone this repository, install TensorFlow and Python 3, and verify
the notebook runs at least the first two cells.

## Topics

Content focused on introductory TensorFlow usage, framework comparisons, and
demo implementations of linear regression and a standard feed-forward neural
network.

## Impact

The event saw roughly 30% more RSVPs than prior PyData Denver meetups, prompting
a venue change from the basement to the 4th floor atrium and resulting in a
highly engaged, interactive session.

## Status

This repository is preserved as historical workshop material from the
TensorFlow 1.x era.
